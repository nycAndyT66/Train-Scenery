# Train-Scenery
Something I created during class...

## Why did I make this?
I wanted to create something that has a very nice scene. My original idea of this wasn't originially a train, the idea was originally a scenery of a man laying on a tree on a cliff watching the sun set and rise.

## What was the proccess to make this?

I break down each component into different part where one code is dedicated to the model of the train and when finished would be imported into the main code and other would be dedicated to functions where i can test if it works or not before importing it into the main project that house all of these minor functions/models.

## Functions:
Currently there are two functions as of now being
- Day Night Cycle through a buttons
### Random Events:
- Boulder on a track

I am still looking for more ideas for functions that is nice to view or interactive.
